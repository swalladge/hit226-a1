      <h1> Accessibility </h1>

        A few examples of how webpages and content can be made accessible to everyone, regardless of the device they use or disabilities they may have.

      <h2> Dyslexic Font </h2>
      <p>
        The font used in this section, assuming your browser supports it, is the <a href="http://opendyslexic.org/">Open Dyslexic</a> font (version 3). 
        It's an open source font aimed to make it easy for dyslexic people to read text on the computer.

    <section id="responsive" class="block"> 
      <h2> Responsiveness </h2>
      <p>
        This whole webpage is designed to be responsive to almost any screen size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of columns on this page changes depending on the screen size. On a large monitor there will be three columns, while on a small device (like a phone) there will only be one column.
      </p>
      <p>
        The navbar is also designed to be usable on any screen size.

      <h2> Screen Reader </h2>
      <table>

    <section id="mediaqueries" class="block"> 
      <h2> CSS Media queries </h2>
      <p>
        Media queries allow certain blocks of css to only be processed if information about the user's device matches the query.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site's CSS includes media queries to modify the layout if the user has a large desktop screen, average laptop size screen, or small screen (as on a phone or tablet).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following media query and contained CSS makes the navbar change layout when screen size is small:
      </p>
      <code> @media (max-width: 600px) { .nav-item {display: block;} } </code>
