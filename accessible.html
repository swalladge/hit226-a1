    <h1 class="page-title"> Accessibility </h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        A few examples of how webpages and content can be made accessible to everyone, regardless of the device they use or disabilities they may have.

    <div class="wide block-box">
    <section id="dyslexic" class="block dyslexic">
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Dyslexic Fonts </h2>
      <p>
        The font used in this section, assuming your browser supports it, is the <cite><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/references/#ref-dyslexic">OpenDyslexic</a></cite> font (version 3).
        It's an open source font aimed to make it easy for people with dyslexia to read text on the computer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="responsive" class="block">
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Fluid Layout </h2>
      <p>
        This whole page is designed to be fluid and fit any screen size.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of columns on this page changes depending on the screen size. On a large monitor there will be multiple columns, while on a phone there will only be one column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluid layouts make webpages easy to view and navigate on any screen size.
      </p>

    <section id="screen-reader" class="block">
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Screen Reader and Tables </h2>
      <table>
        <caption>Table techniques for screen reader accessibility <cite>(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/references/#ref-webaim">WebAIM 2015</a>)</cite></caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th class="right" scope="col">Technique</th>
            <th scope="col">Result</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">caption element</th>
            <td>gives a summary of what the table is about</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">clear headings</th>
            <td>makes it clear what each cell in the table is about</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">scope attribute</th>
            <td>tells the reader that a header is for a row or a column</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        The table above contains attributes that give a screen reader information to be able to read out the data sensibly.

    <section id="alt" class="block">
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Alt Attributes </h2>

      <p>
       Alt text set on an image via the alt attribute is used as a placeholder to explain the image if it fails to load or screen reader software is being used. <cite>(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/references/#ref-mdnalt">Mozilla Developer Network 2016</a>)</cite>
      </p>

      <figure class="block-image">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/alt-attribute.png" title="Oh so meta..."
             alt="An image explaining that an alt attribute is useful. Unfortunately, in this case it is so self-referencial that this explanation is pointless.">
        <!--
          Note: abusing title texts on images here due to humour being needed, the influence of xkcd comics,
                the fact that the alt attribute or a figcaption are more reliable,
                the fact that not all mobile browsers enable you to see title text on a touchscreen,
                and the myriads of articles on the internet suggesting that title text is not serious (except in some small edge cases).

      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> CSS Media queries </h2>
      <p>
        Media queries are the core of responsive design. They allow certain blocks of CSS to only be processed if information about the user's device matches the query.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site's CSS includes media queries to modify the layout if the user has a large desktop screen, average laptop size screen, or small screen (as on a phone or tablet).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following media query and contained CSS makes the navbar change to a flat layout when screen size is large.
      </p>
      <pre>
@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .nav-item {
    display: inline-block;
  }
}
      </pre>

    </section>

    <section id="images" class="block">
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Responsive Images </h2>

      <p>
        Images also need to be responsive so that they are viewable regardless of the device used to view them.
      </p>

      <figure class="block-image">
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/geometric.png" title="At least this image is interesting to look at." alt="Demo image showing perfect squares and circles.">
        <figcaption> A responsive image that will resize to fit and keep its aspect ratio across all screen sizes. </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section id="resp-header" class="block">
      <!-- note: there appears to be a bug in Google Chrome (at least the one I'm testing this on), both on desktop and mobile
                 that make it not scroll up to #top when "return to top" link clicked... :\
      -->
      <div class="top-link right"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></div>
      <h2> Responsive Header </h2>
      <p>
        The header respond to the screen size well, changing layout or style to suit a large or small screen.
        If the header contains navigation links, the user must have good access to it to navigate the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        The header on this site gives an easy to see, wide layout on large screens, but a more compact, easy to navigate version on small screens.
      </p>
    </section>
    </div>
