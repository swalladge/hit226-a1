    <h2> Responsive Design </h2>
    <p>
    Responsive design is all about making a website accessible on any type or size of device; it must <em>respond</em> to the device characteristics, such as screen size. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/responsive/">article on responsive design</a>.
    </p>

    <h2> Accessibility </h2>
    <p>
    However, there is more to designing sites to be <em>accessible</em> for everyone than just responsive design (although that makes up a large part)!
    The designer must also consider users accessing it under varying circumstances.
    For example, they may use a screen reader or be dyslexic.
