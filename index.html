    <p>
    Responsive design is all about make a website respond to different screen sizes. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/responsive/">read more...</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    However, there is more to designing sites to be <em>accessible</em> for everyone than just responsive design! 
    Although having a site that is viewable and runnable on any device is essential, one must also consider those accessing it under varying circumstances. 
    For example, they may be using a screen reader, be dyslexic, or colour-blind.
