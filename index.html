      <h2> Responsive Design </h2>
      <p>
      Responsive design is all about making a website accessible on <em>any type or size of device</em>. The site must respond to device characteristics, such as screen size, to display a usable site. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/responsive/">article on responsive design</a>.

      <h2> Accessibility </h2>
      <p>
      However, there is more to designing <em>accessible sites</em> than just responsive design (although that is a large part)!
      The designer must also consider users with disabilities.
      For example, they may use a screen reader or be dyslexic.
