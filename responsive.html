        <h2>What is responsive design</h2>

        <p>
        Responsive design is about designing a webpage (or any interface really) so that it looks good and is usable on a range of devices with varying screen sizes and types.
        A responsively designed website will look good on everything from smartphones with touch screens, to large desktop monitors.

        <h2>Why should I be concerned about responsive design</h2>

        <p>
        Years ago, no-one cared about responsive design, because if someone had a computer, they had a desktop with a standard 4:3 monitor. 
        Webpages featured hard coded styles (font sizes, width, etc.), and it was all okay.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now, we access webpages on everything: 4" smartphones, 7" ereaders, 10" tablets, 14" notebooks, 17" laptops, 27" desktops, and 40" TVs, sometimes with a mouse, other times with a touchscreen. 
        In this age, responsive design is <em>paramount</em>. An impressive three column layout looks great on a desktop, but awful on a smartphone. 
        Large font and iconic buttons make it easy for small touch screen navigation, but sub-optimal on a large screen.
        Your users will want to access their site from every device they own and expect to be actually able to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>Be concerned.</em>

        <h2>My list of responsive design tips</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Make sure navbars are accessible for touch screens and are responsive to screen size.</li>
          <li>Design for mobile first. (a site that works nicely on your powerful desktop might struggle on a slow, small phone. This means responsive design as well as thinking about optimizing for less powerful devices and slow network connections) <cite>(<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/references/#ref-frost">Frost 2012</a>)</cite></li>
          <li>Test it on as many browsers and devices as possible.</li>
          <li>Some browsers (at least Chrome and Firefox) have a responsive design testing mode - really useful!</li>
          <li>Set the viewport. (otherwise bad things happen on mobiles...)</li>
          <li>Design the html structure first, then use CSS to style and make it responsive.</li>
          <li>CSS media queries are essential.</li>
        </ul>
