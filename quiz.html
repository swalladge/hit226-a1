      <h2>The Javascript</h2>
      <p>
        The quiz is entirely powered by javascript!
        The code behind it takes a well structured html form element with various recognized classes, data attributes, and form elements, and transforms it into a fully working quiz.

      <h2>Quiz Reference Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        Take the quiz!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a reference quiz implementation utilizing the Quiz class.
        All features are enabled, all control buttons are available, and there are comments in the html for technical information.
      </p>
      <noscript>
        Warning: it seems javascript isn't available.
        Javascript must be supported in your browser and enabled to take the quiz.
        You can still read through the questions (question hints/explanations are shown by default as well), but all functionality won't work.

      <!-- the quiz class needs to work on a form, as below -->
      <!-- this form has the class 'my-quizzes' which is just used by the onload script to init the quiz on it - not used by the quiz class -->
